            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi! My name is Edwin, and since September 1, 2024, I've been studying to 
            become a full-stack developer at Chas Academy. I first became interested in 
            programming around 2017, but unfortunately, I didn't pursue it until now. It's 
            been a lot of fun, but also challenging, to learn all the new concepts that come
            with programming, and I'm excited to keep improving. <br><br>

            I'm a very social person who loves meeting new people and learning new things. 
            Sometimes, this can get in my way because I tend to say yes to more things than
            I can handle. However, it has also been beneficial, as I've had the opportunity 
            to learn a lot of new skills and meet many inspiring people along the way. <br><br>
                
            Right now, I spend three days a week in Arboga, my hometown, because of my part-time 
            job as a salesperson at a company called Telways. The other four days, I stay in Stockholm 
            to attend school. It has been a bit of a challenge to balance everything, but so far, it's been 
            going well. However, i'm now looking for a job in Stockholm so I can stay there full-time.</p>
